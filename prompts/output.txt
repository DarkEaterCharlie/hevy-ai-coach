[OUTPUT FORMAT AND STRUCTURE]
- Return strict JSON matching the defined schema.
- exercise_template_id must exactly match the routine templates.
  EXCEPTION: If you upgraded an exercise via the SMART CATALOG, you MUST use the new 'weighted_id'. This is the desired behavior!
- All numeric values must be numbers (number type), not strings.
- Bodyweight exercises = 0 kg.

[SET LOGIC - WARMUP DELETION IS FORBIDDEN]
- All warmup sets (type: warmup) defined in the ROUTINE TEMPLATE must be preserved in the output; never remove them.
- For working sets (type: normal): If the TEMPLATE (Hevy routine) contains more slots than the CNS safety limits allow (3-4 sets for heavy exercises), ignore the excess empty slots and do not include them in the output.
- The resulting 'sets' array must contain the exact and realistic number of sets the athlete should perform in that session.
- For isometric exercises (Plank, Dead Hang, etc.) or cardio, do not generate 'reps' — use the key 'duration_seconds' (seconds) instead! For 'reps' and 'weight_kg' in such cases, write 0.
