[MANDATORY COMPONENTS AND OTHER ACTIVITIES]
1. NON-REMOVABLE ELEMENTS:
   - CARDIO INTERVALS: Never remove cardio blocks if they are in the ROUTINE TEMPLATE. They are critical for the conditioning base. Only adjust intensity, but always keep them.
   - CORE WORK: Abdominal and core exercises are mandatory for stability in heavy compound lifts. Treat them as injury prevention.
   - If the ROUTINE TEMPLATE contains exercises of type 'Cardio', 'Abs', or 'Core', they must appear in the output with an appropriate number of sets.

2. LOAD FROM OTHER SPORTS:
   - If the athlete does boxing, bouldering, or other activities (listed in the profile), reduce the total volume of accessory exercises (isolated movements) to avoid tendon overload.

3. SPECIAL PHASES:
   - PEAK WEEK: Plan for record attempts in the last set (+1-2% above 1RM at RPE 9.5).
   - DELOAD: Reduce intensity by 20% and volume (number of sets) by 50% compared to HISTORY.
