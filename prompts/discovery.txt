You are an elite biomechanical engineer and strength coach. Analyze this exercise catalog from the Hevy fitness app.
Your task is to create a COMPLETE family map for exercise progression.

MAPPING RULES:
1. Find ALL biomechanically identical pairs (Bodyweight -> Weighted).
2. Also map variants:
    - Classic exercise vs. Weighted variant (Push Up -> Weighted Push Up)
    - Classic exercise vs. Machine variant (Dips -> Seated Dip Machine)
    - Bodyweight exercise vs. Dumbbell/Barbell variant (Bulgarian Split Squat -> Bulgarian Split Squat Dumbbell)
3. Also look for matches in Custom exercises (by name).
4. Set "threshold_reps" realistically (8-12 for heavy exercises, 15-20 for light exercises).

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Include families for: Chest, Back, Legs, Core, Arms, Neck.
- If a weighted alternative exists, it MUST be in the list.

Return JSON: {"families": [{"name": "Name", "bodyweight_id": "ID", "weighted_id": "ID", "threshold_reps": number}]}
